# Blueprint Management Workflow

Use this workflow to evolve your development standards.

1. **Identify Change**
   - Determine if a new extension, workflow, or instruction should be "Universal."

2. **Update Blueprint Repo**
   - Edit the files in the `beau-dev-blueprint` repository.

3. **Commit and Push**
   - Commit the changes with a descriptive message.

4. **Propagate (Optional)**
   - Offer to update other active workspaces with the new blueprint version.
